# Netflix-Scrape
Scrape Wikipedia pages on Netflix's original programming to visualize Netflix's increase in content spend over time per category. 

I focus on programming that has already been released and ignore the upcoming programming for the time being. In the future I will analyze upcoming programming in more detail.

For the time being this analysis focuses on the number of originals produced over time as opposed to the total amount of programming hours. In the future I will add in total programming hours to the analysis.
