# Netflix-Scrape
In this analysis I demonstrate how to scrape Wikipedia pages on Netflix's original programming to visualize Netflix's increase in content spend over time per category:

List of Netflix Original Stand-Up Comedy Specials:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Netflix_original_stand-up_comedy_specials

List of Netflix Original Films:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Netflix_original_films

List of Netflix Original Programming:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Netflix_original_programming

I focus on programming that has already been released and ignore the upcoming programming for the time being. In the future I will analyze upcoming programming in more detail.

For the time being this analysis focuses on the number of originals produced over time as opposed to the total amount of programming hours produced. In the future I will add in total programming hours to the analysis.

Wikipedia's pages on Netflix's original programming are very detailed, but it's possible that it misses some content. This analysis prioritizes accuracy over precision.
